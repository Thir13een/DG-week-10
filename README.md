EDA Performed: 
1. Customer Age Distribution: The age distribution is bimodal, with peaks around 20 
and 40-50 years, indicating two main customer age groups. The dataset skews 
towards younger customers. 
2. Customer Seniority: Most customers have low seniority (<50 months), with a steady 
decline in longer-tenure customers, suggesting a largely new customer base with 
opportunities for retention strategies. 
3. Primary Customer Status and Relation: The primary_customer_status is highly 
imbalanced, predominantly 1.0. The start_of_month_customer_relation is more 
balanced between two categories (A and I), providing better differentiation for 
customer behavior analysis. 
4. Financial Product Usage: current_account_status dominates customer product 
use, while saving_account_status and credit_card_status have significantly lower 
usage, indicating room for growth in these products. 
5. Household Income Distribution: Income is highly right-skewed, with most 
households falling in the low-income range and a few high-income outliers. There’s 
potential for segmentation based on income groups. 
6. Customer Segmentation: Clustering analysis identified distinct customer segments 
based on customer_age, household_income, and customer_seniority_months, 
revealing the potential to create tailored marketing strategies for these segments. 
Final Recommendation: 
1) Customer Segmentation and Personalization: 
• Employ KMeans customer clusters to develop focused marketing campaigns and 
product offerings. The distinct age-income groups have unique financial needs, in 
which banking products can be marketed. 
• Your core customer base ranges from low to moderate-income households. You will 
develop products serving their needs, such as credit at an affordable cost, micro- 
savings products, or basic current accounts. 
2) Strategy and Diversification: 
• Given the current account usage dominance, create awareness of and benefits 
about savings accounts and credit card products for diversified usage of the product 
and deepening the relationships with customers. 
• The bimodal distribution of both age and tenure indicates different customer 
lifecycles. Create product offerings in line with customer lifecycle, such as youth 
accounts, family savings plans, or retirement-oriented products targeting older 
segments. 
3) Customer Retention and Growth: 
• Since the composition of recently acquired customers is very high, focus on 
onboarding and retention programs to increase tenure for converting into long- 
standing customers. 
• As the high-income segment is small in composition yet significant in number, 
senior customers with long tenures need to be targeted with premium products, 
wealth management services, or exclusive benefits to maximize revenue potential. 
4) Customer Relationship and Engagement: 
• A and I Categories Use the balance of A and I- probably active and inactive states of 
customers-to create strategies for their activation or re-engagement, while keeping 
the active ones. 
• Some of the channels through which the customers join are more engaging; hence, 
optimize them to perform better in acquiring and retaining customers. 
5) Retention and Loyalty Programs: 
• Younger customers form a big chunk; it is vital to engage them and introduce 
programs on loyalty/engagement that will help customers be with the bank for life as 
they grow through different life stages. 
• Communication and engagement with each segment should be through their 
channels of communication and finance to enhance customer experience and 
overall satisfaction. 
6) Monitoring and Evaluation: 
• Monitoring, on a regular basis, the use of different financial offerings, such as 
savings accounts and credit cards, by varied segments of customers to review 
marketing strategies and product development. 
• Continuously map evolving customer segments to build changing behaviors and 
preferences that will enable nimble adjustments to marketing and product strategy.
